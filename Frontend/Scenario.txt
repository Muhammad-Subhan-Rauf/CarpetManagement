contractors are payed wages for their work. 

the wages are decided upon the size/quality and how much stock was used in the carpet

the price of the carpet is the wage of the contractor. 

contractors can incur fines based on delayed payments (fine decided by user)

scenario:
    contractor comes to buy 5kg of wool and 5kg of silk at 50rs and 80rs respectively
    his wage is now 5*50 + 5*80 = 650
    lets say he only ended up using 5kg of wool and 2 kg of silk in the carpet
    the contractor can either return the remaining carpet or the price of the remaining carpet will be cut from price (650 - 3*80 = 410)
    if the contractor returns the stock, the stock will be added back to the inventory and the price will be cut same as before

scenario 2:
    lets say contractor delayes the cartpet by 5 days, then the user can enter penelty per day lets say 5rs per day
    the contractor will be fined 25rs and that amount will be cut from his price/wage


we need to store how much stock the contractor has taken from us

the stock will be organized by the quality and the type of the stock

search functionality based on shade card / design number

inventory management (user can manually add subtract stock aswell)
